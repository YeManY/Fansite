 <h1 class="Disco">Panda Eyes's Discography</h1>
 <div id="main1">
 <h2>Air Traffic (2014)</h2>
 <p>This was Panda Eyes very first Album, and to be honest, it wasn't very good. The production quality was pretty questionable and had a lot of songs ranging from Underwhelming to Boring. Then again, this is his first Album. So i can't really bash it to much. It is pretty impressive for someone to make music like that at the age of 16.</p></div>
 <div id="main2">
 <h2>KIKO (2015)</h2>
 <p>A gargantuous step up from his previous album. The production quality has increased by a huge amount and he has gotten better at everything, Melodies, Bass, Beats, and everything in between. His melodies improved with songs like ILY and KIKO (the title song), his Bass improves with songs like The Returning, Weed and Fries, and Colorblind.
 At the time, it was most certainely his best work.<p></div>
 <div id="main3">
 <h2>Immortal Flame (With Teminite) ft. Anna Yvette (Single) (2015)</h2>
 <p>To this day, this single still remains Panda Eyes's best work, at least in my Opinion. His classic style has developed into a style of Glitch-Hop combined with chiptune and it sounds absoulutely fantastic. His style blends together with Teminite's beautifully in this song. Also, let's not forget about Anna Yvette's goregous vocals that were added as well. They are the icing on top of this magnificent cake, they do this song justice better then any person that could've been added.<p></div>
 <div id="main4">
 <h2>Superheros (Virtual Riot x Panda Eyes) (Single) (2015)</h2>
 <p>Virtual Riot is another artist who specializes in electronic damnce music. His style is actually a lot similar to that of Panda Eyes, in fact there are quite a mojority of people who prefer VR to Panda Eyes, and I can see why. He definitely has better sound-design, but weather he has better melodies is debatable. This song in paticular is a collaboration between the two, and it is definitely glorious to listen to. It's also good to mention that it's a mash-up of several dubstep classics, which is just one of the many things that makes this song amazing.<p></div>
 <div id="main5">
 <h2>Nostalgia 64 (2016)</h2>
 <p>Once again, the production quality of Panda Eyes increases again. Nostalgia 64 is an EP that consists of 7 dubstep songs, all of them are incredible. Not as good as Immortal Flame, but are still awesome none the less. The thing with this EP is that it's  improved sound design, the distorted bass has gotten much better then his previous work, and it shows here.<p></div>
 <div id="main6">
 <h2>Lightbreaker (Single) (2016)</h2>
 <p>Without a doubt, the Panda Eyes song that has hands down the best Sound Design. The heavy detail in the distorted base easily outmatches some of Virtual Riot's songs. Panda Eyes demonstraits here that he has very good knowlage when it comes to Sound design in dubstep. Easily among the best he has done.<p></div>
 <div id="main7">
 <h2>Seven Lions - Days to Come (Ft. Fiora) (Single) (Panda Eyes remix) (2017)</h2>
 <p>Now I'll admit this, I do not belive that Panda Eyes is very good at remixing songs. In the past whenever he does remix a song it's from terruble to barely passable. This on the other hand is completely different. This is not only the best remix panda Eyes has done, but one of the best songs he's ever done, period. This song is a perfect mix between heavy and melodic. Panda Eyes epically switches back and fourth between disctorted bass and beautiful melodies in a similar fashion to Virtual Riot. This song is magical.<p></div>
 <div id="main8">
 <h2>Continue (2017)</h2>
 <p>The latest Album Panda Eyes has produced and is easily just as amazing, if not better, then KIKO. Panda Eyes delves into different genre's of Electronic music, from Future-Bass to Electro house. Heck, he even sings in one of the songs. Easily the album he did the most experimentation on. Easily one of the best things to come out of 2017.<p></div>
 <div id="main9">
 <h2>Serotonin (Single) (2017)</h2>
 <p>Among the worst songs Panda has produced, I'm sorry but this is among his weakest work. It's a very very bland dubstep song that doesn't nearly hold a candle to his other works. </p></div>
 <div id="main10">
 <h2>Take My Hand (ft. Azuria Sky) (Single) (2017)</h2>
 <p>The second track Panda has sung on and it's awesome. Probably the best thing he's released in 2017 aside from his Continue album. Panda Eyes should seriously start singing in a lot more tracks of his.</p></div>
 <div id="main11">
 <h2>Burnout (Single) (2017)</h2>
 <p>Epic electro track with a catchy melody/synth and epic sound design. Straight fire.</p></div>

   <h1 class="collab">Collaborations Panda Eyes Has Done</h1>
   <div id="collab1">
   <h2>Panda Eyes x Teminite - Highscore (KIKO)</h2>
   <p>Said to be one of the best electronic dance songs inspired by video games. The heavy wubs, spectacular synths and hard-hitting snares get you out of your seat and dancing along to the madness that is this song.<p></div>
   <div id="collab2">
   <h2>Panda Eyes x Teminite - Adventure Time</h2>
   <p>The second time Panda Eyes and Teminite have collaborated, and while it's not as good as Highscore, it's still got awesome production quality, awesome melodies and almost everything else that made their first collaboration great.</p></div>
   <div id="collab3">
   <h2>Panda Eyes x Teminite - Immortal Flame (Ft. Anna Yvette)<h2>
   <p>The third time Panda Eyes and Teminite have collaborated and not only is it the best song they've done together, not only is it the best collaboration Panda Eyes has done to date, but it's the best song Panda Eyes has ever done. One of the best Synth melodies I've heard in a song, and some of the best vocals I've heard in a song.</p></div>
   <div id="collab4">
   <h2>Panda Eyes x Virtual Riot - Superheros</h2>
   <p>An insane mash-up of several memorable dubstep songs that I love. This song serves as a wonderful tribute to the genre as a whole, any fan of dusbstep will cry from the nostalgia. A wonderful mash-up and wonderful song all around.</p></div>
   <div id="collab5">
   <h2>Panda Eyes x Shivaji - Aurora</h2>
   <p>It's an ok song, it's nothing special, it's nothing compared to some of the others songs Panda has done though.</p></div>
   <div id="collab6">
   <h2>Panda Eyes x Fyer - Shuriken</h2>
   <p>Panda Eyes's sweet dubstep beats combined with Fyer's sweet electric guitar. Epic drop, Epic guitar,just an overall great exeperience listening to this.</p></div>
   <div id="collab7">
   <h2>Panda Eyes x Subkey - Continue</h2>
   <p>One of the best electro tracks of 2017, and easily one of the best song Panda has produced. Featured on the Album of the same name, crisp production here.</p></div>
   <div id="collab8">
   <h2>Panda Eyes x Subkey - Dark Matter</h2>
   <p>The most experimental thing Panda Eyes has produced by far. Unlike anything else he's made, this is a dark atmosphereic dubstep track. Something you'd see on UKF or The Dub Rebellion. This song is actually kind of reminicent of Trap, with that classic Trap horn you usually see in Trap music. Good amount of heavy and chill.</p></div>
   <div id="collab9">
   <h2>Panda Eyes x Subkey - Galaxia</h2>
   <p>This song is tied with Second Life as best song of Panda's Continue Album. This is a Melodic Drumstep song reminicent of Melodies similar to those from KIKO. This is one of the best songs I've ever heard from 2017. This song is compareable to Immortal Flame, it's that good, 10/10.<p></div>

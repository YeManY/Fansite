    <h1 class="how">How Panda Eyes's Musical Style Has Developed Over The Years</h1>
    <div id="growth1">
    <h2>2014</h2>
    <p>Panda Eyes started making music when he was 13, and he slowly got better and better till he released his first Album "Air Traffic". It had very simple production, nothing special, It never carried any weight. But, he was 16 at that time, he wasn't exactly a musical genius at that time. After "Air Traffic" he then slowly got better and better. Releasing songs like "For You" and "Miracle", his style was progressing and he was showing lots and lots of improvement. Then came along KIKO.</p></div>
    <div id="growth2">
    <h2>2015</h2>
    <p>KIKO, KIKO was another Album released by Panda Eyes, and it is definitely infinitely superior to that of Air Traffic. It was outstanding, it had so many memorable songs such as "Highscore","Colorblind","The Returning" and of course, the title song "KIKO" (which was named after his Girlfriend). Panda Eyes's style definitely improved so much in one year. He then goes and releases "Euphoria" which is probably his best Drum and Bass song yet, and then none other then "Immortal Flame". I'm telling you, Immortal Flame is a masterpiece, no ther way to describe it, it is Panda's best work by far. His style has reached a new height at this time.</p></div>
    <div id="growth3">
    <h2>2016</h2>
    <p>At this point, Panda Eyes's sound-design starts to show signs of large improvement. During this year, he released the EP "Nostalgia 64". It features 7 epic well-produced Dubstep songs. Some are hardcore grimey heavy dubstep, some are straight up melodic and some are a mix of both. Actually, during this year Panda Eyes was really keen on heavy dupstep. Nostalgia 64 was probably the only heavily melodic song that he made in 2016. Even so, Nostalgia 64 was definitely a highlight of the year.</p></div>
    <div id="growth4">
    <h2>2017</h2>
    <p>This is when Panda Eyes's musical style has truely reached it's peak. He released a full length album on September 1st titled "Continue". Here, he experiments with multiple musical styles and genre's. From Future Bass to Chill Trap to even singing on his own track. He's starting to approach Virtual Riots level of Music production. After that he then starts releasing epic singles such as "Take My Hand" (where he once again sings) and "Burnout". His style gets increasingly better as time goes on and on, and I'm very excited to see where he will go from here on out.</p></div>
